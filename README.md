## Rules

Quoridor is an abstract game for 2 players (or 4 players).

### Setup

Each player has a meeple and a set of walls.

The players stay on opposite sides of the board.

Each player puts his meeple on the bord in the center of the nearest row.

### Goal of the Game

The board is a 9x9 matrix where there is room for walls between each pair of tiles.

A player wins when his meeple is moved to the opposite side of the board.

### Moves

A player can either:

- move his meeple to an adjacent square in any direction (forward, backward, left, right)
- place a wall

Note that when a player has no more walls, he cannot use them anymore.
